Basic Command Syntax (PS format)
[./wdp.exe <command> <arg1> <arg2> <arg3>...<argN>]

COMMAND LIST__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

help - [./wdp.exe help]
  Displays user guide and list of commands.
  (The ug_wdp.txt must be present in the same directory as the executable)

org - [./wdp.exe org <target_dir>]
  Non recursively arranges files in the target directory into sub directories based on extension.
  (If sub directory of the format <ext_Files> does not exists, it is created)

tks - [./wdp.exe tks <target_dir> <token_string>]
  Recursively searches target directory and displays files with only a substring of their filename passed as token.
  (If filename entirely matches token, it is displayed followed by script termination)

ds - [./wdp.exe ds <src_dir> <dest_dir> <-flag>]
  Performs one way directory syncronization by syncronizing destination directory with source directory.
  FLAG : -s (status)
  [./wdp.exe ds <src_dir> <dest_dir> -s]
    Enumerates source directory files and directories.
    For each file, checks if destination has a copy of it or not.
      If Not displays message.
      If yes, compares last write dates to check for possible updates.
        displays message if source file was further edited after destination file's last edit.
    For directories, recursively follws the same steps.
  FLAG : -u (update)
  [./wdp.exe ds <src_dir> <dest_dir> -u]
    Follows the same steps and makes necessary changes so that the files and directories in destination match the ones in source.
    (If a file exists only in destination and not source, it is not tracked as the syncronization is one way)

dt - [./wdp.exe dt <dir_path>]
  Displays directory's files and sub-directories recursively in a tree like format by enumerating over each file or directory. 
  (ignores traversal in directories starting with '.', eg: .git)

tc - [./wdp.exe tc <target_dir> -ol <age_in_MONTHS> <-flag>]
  Performs collection of files older than a specified number of months recursively from target directory
  to a newly formed trashbin recursively. 
  (ignores traversal in directories starting with '.', eg: .git) 
  FLAG : -s (status)
  [./wdp.exe tc <target_dir> -ol <age_in_MONTHS> -s]
    Recursively displays all the files older than specified age from the target and any subdirectory in it.
  FLAG : -u (update)
  [./wdp.exe tc <target_dir> -ol <age_in_MONTHS> -u]
    Along with the functions of status flag, also moves the files into trashbin, which is created in the target if does not already exists.
    ASKS FOR EXTRA CONFIRMATION
